    <h1>A Soft Cover Book Report</h1>
    <h3>Moby-Dick (or, The Whale) </h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/" target="_blank">Softcover</a> publishing platform was design mainly for ebooks like some popular IT textbooks but it's also good for making more traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below a short and affectionately irreverent book  report on this classic of American literature.</p>

    <p><strong>Moby-Dick: A classic tale of the sea</strong></p>

    <p><a href="https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick" target="_blank"><em>Moby-Dick</em></a> by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:</p>
    <p>Call me Ismael. Some years ago-never mind how long  precisely-having little or no money in my purse and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.</p>
    <p>After driving of his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you),Ismael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one million pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who-<em>spoiler alert!</em>-is a giant white whale) is the book itself.</p>
